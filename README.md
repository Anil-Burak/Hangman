It was created for playing hangman game with a friend who is far from you.

You can select a word, type it into the game
and game will give you the input that you should
send to your friend via text.
After the input of guess letter, the game will continue
to give the output that will be copied.

Code is potato and doesn't include much "try expect" blocks
cause why would anyone try to crash a basic hangman game?
