It was created for playing hangman game with a friend who is far from you.

You can select a word, type it into the game
and game will give you the input that you should
send to your friend via text
After the input of guess letter, the game will continue
to give the output that will be copied.

Code is potato and doesn't include so much "try expect" 
cause why would you try to crash a basic hangman game?
